1. Make sure ligands and multiple chains work properly [x]
2. Make alanine-izaton optional     [x]
3. Re-intergrate flexible residues [x]
4. CLEANCODE
    a) docstrings and comments  [x]
    b) type annotations         [x]
        - str to os.PathLike    [x]
    c) better imports           []
5. Sort out process_vina_outputs for flexible docking [X]
    a) fix elements               [x]
    b) fix chainID for ligands     [X]
        - get resName for each ligand 
        - use that in read_docking_results
6. Add GNINA as another way to do docking simulation        []
    - this should use *most* of the setup functionallity
    - but may require different file formats
    - will need more of a look at the GNINA-spesific parameters
7. Update README.md     [x]
    - scwrl4 installation [x]

8. Replace scwrl4 with something less annoying to install []
