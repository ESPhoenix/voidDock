6. Add GNINA as another way to do docking simulation        []
    - this should use *most* of the setup functionallity
    - but may require different file formats
    - will need more of a look at the GNINA-spesific parameters


8. Replace scwrl4 with something less annoying to install []


9. add any custom args for gnina or vina to the config file []

1. collate_docked_pdbs back on

2. work out a way of docking multiple ligands at the same time with GNINA (works with vina)

## FINAL GNINA COMMAND:
ginia -l {[ligand.sdf,:], --config.txt}
